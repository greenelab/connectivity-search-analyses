# hetmech: extracting mechanisms from hetnets

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/greenelab/hetmech.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/greenelab/hetmech)

Hetmech aims to identify the relevant network connections between a set of query nodes.
The method is designed to operate on hetnets (networks with multiple node or relationship types). 

This project is still under development. Use with caution.

## Environment
