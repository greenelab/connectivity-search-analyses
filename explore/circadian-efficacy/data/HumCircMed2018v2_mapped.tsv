Rivaroxaban intake in the evening reduced morning F1+2 concentrations better at 8:00 AM than did administration on awakening (85 ± 25 nmol L(-1) vs. 106 ± 34 nmol L(-1) , CI: 9.4-32.1). In addition, this suppression effect was longer lasting after evening intake. Takeaway: evening intake of rivaroxaban leads to prolonged exposure to rivaroxaban concentrations and better matches the morning hypofibrinolysis.
