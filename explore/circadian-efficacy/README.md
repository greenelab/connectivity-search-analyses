+ [`downloads/HumCircMed2018v2.xlsx`](downloads/HumCircMed2018v2.xlsx) contains the data to generate Figure S1 from [version 1 of the "Dosing Time Matters" preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/570119v1.full).

+ [`downloads/aat8806_Data_file_S1.xlsx`](downloads/aat8806_Data_file_S1.xlsx) contains data from CircaDB, which provides tissue-specific rhythmical scores for human genes. 
  The data was downloaded from Data file S1 of [A database of tissue-specific rhythmically expressed human genes has potential applications in circadian medicine](https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aat8806).
  The algorithm 'CYCLOPS', which was developed to score genes based on circadian rhythms, can be accessed from [CYCLOPS reveals human transcriptional rhythms in health and disease](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1619320114).
