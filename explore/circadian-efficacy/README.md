# Circadian Drug Efficacy

Evaluating unsupervised DWPC p-values and path contributions to predict whether a drug's efficacy is time-of-day dependent.


# Source datasets

+ [`downloads/HumCircMed2018v2.xlsx`](downloads/HumCircMed2018v2.xlsx) contains the data to generate Figure S1 from [version 1 of the "Dosing Time Matters" preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/570119v1.full).

+ [`downloads/aat8806_Data_file_S1.xlsx`](downloads/aat8806_Data_file_S1.xlsx) contains data from CircaDB, which provides tissue-specific rhythmical scores for human genes. 
  The data was downloaded from Data file S1 of [A database of tissue-specific rhythmically expressed human genes has potential applications in circadian medicine](https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aat8806).
  The algorithm 'CYCLOPS', which was developed to score genes based on circadian rhythms, can be accessed from [CYCLOPS reveals human transcriptional rhythms in health and disease](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1619320114).

+ [`downloads/GTEx_Analysis_2016-01-15_v7_RNASeQCv1.1.8_gene_median_tpm.gct.gz`](downloads/GTEx_Analysis_2016-01-15_v7_RNASeQCv1.1.8_gene_median_tpm.gct.gz) contains median expression of all genes in 55 GTEx tissues.
  The data was downloaded from [GTEx V7 RNA-seq data](https://storage.googleapis.com/gtex_analysis_v7/rna_seq_data/GTEx_Analysis_2016-01-15_v7_RNASeQCv1.1.8_gene_median_tpm.gct.gz)

# Generated datasets

+ [`data/disease_doid.tsv`](data/disease_doid.tsv) contains manually curated mapping from therapeutic area to disease ontology ID.

+ [`data/tissue_uberon.tsv`](data/tissue_uberon.tsv) contains manually curated mapping from CircaDB tissue terms to exact Uberon tissue IDs, hetionet Uberon tissue IDs(closest tissue available in hetionet), and GTEx tissue names.

+ [`data/HumCircMed2018v2_mapped.tsv`](data/HumCircMed2018v2_mapped.tsv) is a processed version of [`downloads/HumCircMed2018v2.xlsx`](downloads/HumCircMed2018v2.xlsx). 
  It mapped compound names to DrugBank IDs, mapped therapeutic areas to DOIDs

+ [`data/circa_db_mapped.tsv`](data/circa_db_mapped.tsv) is a processed version of [`downloads/aat8806_Data_file_S1.xlsx`](downloads/aat8806_Data_file_S1.xlsx).
  It organized circadian scores by gene, added median tissue-specific expression value of each gene from GTEx.

# Notebook

+ [`data_id_mapping.ipynb`](data_id_mapping.ipynb) contains the codes that map treatment and CircaDB data to hetionet IDs.
