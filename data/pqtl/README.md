pQTL (protein quantitative trait loci) data within this directory were extracted from literature sources by Pfizer. `snps-to-proximal-genes.tsv` provides proximal genes to lead SNPs in `pqtl.tsv` within 1MB according to genome build GRCh38. 

pQTL proteins with more than one identifier were mapped to their respective Entrez IDs. Because these proteins were measured in their complexed form, they map to multiple gene identifiers.
